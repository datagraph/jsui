            <h2>In Which We Learn to Ask Questions</h2>
            <p>A view is a question you've saved so you can ask it again later. Because sometimes you think of a very good question, and it would be a shame to forget it. The question is written in a special language called SPARQL (which is pronounced "sparkle," like something that glitters).</p>

            <h2>What Views Are For</h2>
            <p>Views are rather useful:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can save questions you ask often</li>
                <li>You can share them with friends</li>
                <li>You can ask them in different ways and get different sorts of answers</li>
                <li>You can keep them all together in one repository, nice and tidy</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Making a New View</h2>
            <p>Here's how to save a new question:</p>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span>
                Go to the repository where you want to keep this question.
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span>
                Find the views section.
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span>
                Click <strong>New View</strong>.
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span>
                Give your question a name. Something that will remind you what it's about.
            </div>

            <div class="float-left">
            <img src="images/view-creation-dialog.png" alt="View creation dialog with name entered">

                <span class="step-number">Step 5:</span>
                Press Enter.

            <div class="clear"></div>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 6:</span>
                A little message pops up to say it worked.

                <span class="step-number">Step 7:</span>
                An editor appears. That's where you write your question.
            </div>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>Important:</strong> Your new view is empty right now. It's like a blank piece of paper. You need to write something on it and save it, or it won't do anything at all.
            </div>

            <h2>Writing Your Question (In the Repository)</h2>
            <p>You can write your question right there in the repository pane.</p>

            <h3>Opening the Editor</h3>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span>
                Go to the repository.
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span>
                Click on the view's name.
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span>
                An editor opens up. It's a nice place to write SPARQL.
            </div>

            <h3>Writing the Question</h3>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span>
                Find the big text area where you can type.
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span>
                Write your SPARQL question. The editor will colour different parts different colours, which is helpful for seeing what's what.
            </div>

            <div class="float-left">
            <img src="images/view-editing-repository-pane.png" alt="View editor in repository pane with query text">

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span>
                Click <strong>Save</strong> to remember it forever (or at least until you change it).
            </div>

            <div class="clear"></div>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span>
                You'll see a message saying it saved. Hooray!
            </div>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>A Shortcut:</strong> If you press Ctrl+Enter (or Cmd+Enter on a Mac), the question runs immediately. You don't have to save it first—though saving is still a good idea.
            </div>

            <h2>Writing in Its Own Window</h2>
            <p>If you'd like more room to write, you can give the view its very own pane.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span>
                Go to the repository.

                <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span>
                Click the little pane button (it looks like a folder with a plus).
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span>
                A whole new pane opens, just for this view. So much room!

            <div class="note">
                <strong>Multiple Windows:</strong> You can have lots of editors open at once, some in the repository pane and some in their own panes. They don't interfere with each other at all.

            <h2>Asking the Question (Running a View)</h2>
            <p>Once you've written a question, you can ask it and get an answer.</p>

            </table>

            <h2>Seeing Answers in a New Window</h2>
            <p>Sometimes it's nice to see results in their very own window, separate from everything else.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span>

            <h2>Deleting a View</h2>
            <p>Sometimes a question isn't useful anymore, and you'd like to tidy it away.</p>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>Be Sure:</strong> When you delete a view, it's gone forever. If you might want the question again someday, copy it somewhere safe first.

            <h2>Nice Things the Editor Can Do</h2>

            <h3>Multiple Tabs</h3>
            <p>The editor can have several tabs, like a notebook with different pages:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each tab has its own question</li>
                <li>Each tab keeps its own answers</li>
                <li>You can flip between them to compare</li>
                <li>Close tabs you don't need anymore</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reset</h3>
            <p>If you've made a mess of your question, click Reset to go back to how it was before you started changing things.</p>

            <h3>The Log</h3>
            <p>There's a little log that remembers what happened—questions you asked, things you saved, any mistakes that occurred, and how long things took.</p>

            <h3>Dragging to a New Window</h3>
            <p>You can grab an editor tab and drag it right out of the browser window, and it becomes its own little window. Rather magical, really.</p>

            <h2>Some Advice About Views</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Names:</strong> Give views sensible names that remind you what they're about</li>
                <li><strong>Organization:</strong> Keep related views in the same repository</li>
                <li><strong>Comments:</strong> You can write notes in your SPARQL using # marks</li>
                <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Try your question before you save it</li>
                <li><strong>Backups:</strong> Keep copies of important questions somewhere safe</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When Things Go Wrong</h2>
            <h3>Won't Save</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Did you click Save?</li>
                <li>Check the log for error messages</li>
                <li>Do you have permission?</li>
                <li>Is your internet working?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Won't Run</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Is there a mistake in your SPARQL?</li>
                <li>Are the addresses in your question right?</li>
                <li>Look at the log for clues</li>
                <li>Is there actually data to ask about?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>View Missing</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Try refreshing the page</li>
                <li>Did it save properly?</li>
                <li>Are you looking in the right repository?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Comes Next</h2>
            <p>Now you know about views! You might like to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask your questions regularly</li>
                <li>Share them with friends</li>
                <li>Build bigger questions from smaller ones</li>
                <li>Read some <a href="tips-and-best-practices.html">helpful hints</a></li>
                <li>Look at the <a href="appendices.html">back of the book</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>That's views, then. Questions you can save and ask again. Rather nice, isn't it?</p>
