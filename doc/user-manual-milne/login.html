            <h2>In Which We Knock on the Door</h2>
            <p>Before you can do anything at all, you must first prove that you are who you say you are. This is called "logging in," and it's rather like showing your invitation at a party. The computer can't just let anyone in, you see. It has to be careful.</p>

            <h2>Where to Go</h2>
            <p>The place you need to visit is here:</p>
            <div class="note">
                <strong>The Address:</strong> <code>https://dydra.com/ui/user</code>
            </div>
            <p>If you haven't logged in yet, you'll see a friendly little form asking you to introduce yourself. If you have logged in (perhaps you forgot?), you'll already be inside, which is rather nice.</p>

            <h2>How to Get In</h2>
            <p>Here's what to do, step by step:</p>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 1:</span>
                Go to <code>https://dydra.com/ui/user</code>. Type it into your browser's address bar and press Enter. Off you go!
            </div>

            <div class="float-right">
            <img src="images/login-form-filled.png" alt="Login form with credentials entered">
            <p class="image-caption">Figure 1: The login form, all filled in and ready.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 2:</span>
                Fill in the blanks. There are three things to tell it:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Host:</strong> Usually <code>https://dydra.com</code> (that's probably already there)</li>
                    <li><strong>Login:</strong> Your username (the name you chose when you joined)</li>
                    <li><strong>Password:</strong> Your secret password (shh, don't tell anyone)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 3:</span>
                Click the <strong>Login</strong> button. (Or just press Enter—either way works perfectly well.)
            </div>

            <div class="clear"></div>

            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">Step 4:</span>
                If everything is right, in you go! You'll see your account page, with all your repositories waiting for you. If something was wrong—perhaps you misremembered your password—it will tell you, and you can try again. Computers are patient like that.
            </div>

            <div class="note">
                <strong>A Curious Thing:</strong> You can actually be logged into more than one account at the same time. Perhaps you have a work account and a home account. The computer doesn't mind at all—it can keep track of both.
            </div>

            <h2>Two Ways to Say Hello</h2>
            <p>There are two different ways to prove you're you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Username and Password:</strong> The usual way. You type your name and your secret word. Humans do this.</li>
                <li><strong>A Special Token:</strong> A long, complicated string of letters and numbers that computers use when talking to each other. You probably won't need to worry about this unless you're writing programs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most people just use their username and password, and that works splendidly.</p>

            <h2>What the Computer Remembers</h2>
            <h3>The Nice Part</h3>
            <p>The computer remembers your username. The next time you come back, it will already be filled in for you. Isn't that thoughtful?</p>

            <div class="warning">
                <strong>The Careful Part:</strong> The computer does NOT remember your password or your login session. When you close the browser tab, poof! You're logged out. This is for your own protection, really. If someone else came along after you left, they couldn't just pretend to be you.
            </div>

            <h3>Saying Goodbye</h3>
            <p>When you're done and want to leave properly:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Find the <strong>Logout</strong> button (it's usually up at the top somewhere)</li>
                <li>Click it</li>
                <li>You'll be back at the login page, safe and sound</li>
                <li>Your username might still be there, waiting for next time</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>If the Door Won't Open</h2>
            <h3>When You Can't Get In</h3>
            <p>Sometimes things don't work. Here are some things to check:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Did you type your password correctly? (Careful with the Caps Lock key—it makes everything SHOUT.)</li>
                <li>Is the Host address right? It should say <code>https://dydra.com</code></li>
                <li>Is your internet working? (Try going to another website to check.)</li>
                <li>Are you sure you have an account?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What the Error Messages Mean</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Invalid credentials"</strong> means either your username or password was wrong. Try again, more carefully.</li>
                <li>If nothing seems to work at all, perhaps the internet is having a difficult day.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you've tried everything and it still won't work, write to <strong>support@dydra.com</strong>. They'll sort it out.</p>

            <h2>Now You're In!</h2>
            <p>Once you've logged in successfully, a whole world of possibilities opens up:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Look at your <a href="account-operations.html">account information</a> (that's you!)</li>
                <li>Play with your <a href="repository-operations.html">repositories</a> (that's where your data lives)</li>
                <li>Create and run <a href="view-operations.html">views</a> (questions for your data)</li>
                <li>Read some <a href="tips-and-best-practices.html">helpful hints</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Welcome in. Do make yourself comfortable.</p>
