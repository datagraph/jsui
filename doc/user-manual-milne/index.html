            <h2>Hello, There</h2>
            <p>This is a book about a thing called Dydra Studio. It lives in your web browser, which is rather nice because that means you don't have to go looking for it in a drawer somewhere.</p>

            <p>Dydra Studio helps you keep track of data. Data is a word for things you know and want to remember. The data lives in little collections called <em>repositories</em>, which is a rather grand word for "a place where things are kept." (Like a cupboard, only for information instead of jam.)</p>

            <h3>What Can It Do?</h3>
            <p>Dydra Studio is what clever people call a "single-page web application," which means that once you've arrived, you don't have to keep going somewhere else. Everything happens right where you are, which is much more comfortable.</p>

            <p>Here are the sorts of things you can do:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Keep your data in repositories (safe and sound)</li>
                <li>Ask questions about your data (and get answers, usually)</li>
                <li>Bring data in from other places (imports)</li>
                <li>Take data out to share with friends (exports)</li>
                <li>Save your favourite questions so you can ask them again (views)</li>
                <li>Change the things written about yourself</li>
                <li>Share with others (if you'd like to)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Before We Begin</h2>

            <h3>Finding the Door</h3>
            <p>To get to Dydra Studio, you'll need to visit this address:</p>
            <div class="note">
                <strong>The Address:</strong> <code>https://dydra.com/ui/user</code>
            </div>
            <p>Type that into your browser, and there you'll be. It's rather like knowing the right path to someone's house.</p>

            <h3>Your Browser</h3>
            <p>You'll need a proper modern browser—the sort that understands JavaScript and doesn't get confused by new things. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge will all do nicely. If you have a very old browser, perhaps it's time for a newer one. (Old browsers mean well, but they do get muddled.)</p>

            <h3>Two Kinds of Doors</h3>
            <p>There are actually two ways into the system:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The User App:</strong> This is the friendly door for everyday people. That's the one we'll talk about.</li>
                <li><strong>The Console:</strong> This is for administrators, who have to do important-sounding things. There's another book about that.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>A Quick Start (For Those in a Hurry)</h3>
            <p>If you're the sort who likes to get straight to things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to <strong>https://dydra.com/ui/user</strong></li>
                <li>Tell it who you are (that's in <a href="login.html">Getting In</a>)</li>
                <li>Do whatever you came to do</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There. That wasn't so hard, was it?</p>

            <h3>What's in This Book</h3>
            <p>We've arranged things in a sensible order:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><a href="login.html">Getting In</a></strong> — How to arrive</li>
                <li><strong><a href="account-operations.html">Your Account</a></strong> — Who you are</li>
                <li><strong><a href="repository-operations.html">Your Repositories</a></strong> — Where your things are kept</li>
                <li><strong><a href="view-operations.html">Your Views</a></strong> — Questions you ask</li>
                <li><strong><a href="tips-and-best-practices.html">Helpful Hints</a></strong> — Things worth knowing</li>
                <li><strong><a href="appendices.html">The Back of the Book</a></strong> — Lists and such</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>If Something Goes Wrong</h3>
            <p>Sometimes things don't work quite right. If that happens, you can write to <strong>support@dydra.com</strong>. They're very nice people who like to help.</p>

            <p>Now then. Shall we begin?</p>
