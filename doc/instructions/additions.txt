  Actual Gaps, by Priority

  1. Repository Creation : implement this as a popup dialog similar to new view. persist as a POST to /system/accounts/{account}/repositories with the simple configuration object (just name and type (lmdb or lmdb-revisioned) as fields. on success, navigate to the new repository's pane for editing.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                               
  2. Password Changes                                                                                                                                                                          
  Implementation: attach input listeners to the password fields so they register as deltas in the account tracker. The save flow already POSTs changed fields to /system/accounts/{account}/configuration — password fields just need to be included in that delta collection.                 
                                                                                                                                                                                               
  3. Auth Token Persistence                                                                                                                                                                    
  change the reset button to not generate a local SHA-1 token, but rather to POST to /{account}/auth_token with no content. it returns an html response with the new token. Parse the response and update the display.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                               
  4. Account Creation (Signup)
  the signup page is present and independent of account creation.
  implement the account creation as part of a separate single-page admin application, as a post to /system/accounts with the name as a minimal configuration. create an account pane to permit editing. this differentiates admin-created accounts from self-signup (as your notes indicate).                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                               
  5. Password Reset / Unlock Pages                                                                                                                                                             
  this is implemented as a link from "forgot your password" to an external page. that page links to further external resources.
                                                                                                                                                                                               
  6. Invitation System                                                                                                                                                                         
  Implement this as part of a separate single-page admin application: wire up POST/DELETE to the invitations endpoint. Low priority per your notes.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                               
  7. Admin Pages (separate SPA)                                                                                                                                                                
  Implement this as part of a separate single-page admin application. The current AdminMenuPage links to 6 undefined routes. Implementation: new SPA with its own routes, page classes,  
  and API calls for account/repository management and history views.                                                                                                                           

                                                                                                                                                                                            
  Dead Code (can be removed or left as-is)
                                                                                                                                                     
remove the dead code: QueriesIndexPage, QueryNewPage, RepositoryImportSuccessPage
