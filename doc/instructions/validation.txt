review the source code again to verify the state. for example i reviewed this analysis and recorded the conclusions in this file (validation.txt).
in light of those conclusions, reexamine the application to revise your analysis and/or propose implementation steps. 

  1. Repository Creation                                                                                                                                                                       
  propose how to implement this : Form exists but has no submit handler. Needs a POST to /system/accounts/{account}/repositories with the form fields (name, homepage, summary, description, license, privacy). Wire up the    
  submit button in afterRender similar to setupInlineLogin.  
  
  2. Repository Import (RDF upload/URL)                                                                                                                                                        
  review the implementation : Three import forms exist (URL, file upload, HDT) with no handlers. The URL import needs a POST to the repository's import endpoint with the source URL and media type. File upload needs     
  FormData with a fetch call.
  review the implementation : it uses a pop-up dialog for this : The repo-import-btn handler exists but the standalone import page forms are not wired.
                                                                           
  3. Repository Settings Forms (About/Privacy/Prefixes)                                                                                                                                        
  review the implementation : it uses the GraphObject state management and does save the changes : RepositoryEditPage renders three tab forms with no submit handlers. The inline double-click editing in the pane sidebar partially covers this, but the dedicated edit page forms need        
  review the implementation : it should save back to the same url use to read the configuration : afterRender handlers that collect form values and call updateRepositoryConfiguration.                                                                                                        

  4. Query/View Creation via Standalone Page                                                                                                                                                   
  review the implementation : the query editor include a save button : QueryNewPage has a name/summary/query form but no handler. Needs a PUT to /system/accounts/{account}/repositories/{repo}/views/{name} with the query text. The in-pane "New" button works.
  review the implementation : which standalone page is meant :  but the standalone page does not.                                                                                                                                                            

  5. Query/View Editing via Standalone Page                                                                                                                                                    
  review the implementation : which standalone page is meant : QueryEditPage form has no handler. Same approach as creation — read form fields and PUT to the view URL.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
  6. Account Creation (Signup)                                                                                                                                                                 
  propose how to implement this : it will require means to differentiate admin status : AccountNewPage and SignupPage have forms but no handlers. Needs a POST to /system/accounts with username, email, and password. Add afterRender to attach a submit listener.                  

  7. Account Profile Editing                                                                                                                                                                   
  review the implementation : there is a sve button on the tab which should save the changed properties back to the configuration location : AccountEditPage has 5 tab forms (profile, password, settings, prefixes, admin) — none submit. Profile fields need a PATCH/PUT to /system/accounts/{account} with the changed fields.
  review the implementation : password changes are part of the configuration : Password change needs a separate endpoint call. The inline pane editing covers some fields, but the dedicated edit page is non-functional.                                                           

  8. Password Reset                                                                                                                                                                            
  review the implementation : password changes are saves a part of configuration : ResetPasswordPage renders a form with no handler. Needs a POST to the password reset endpoint with the email address.                                                                        

  9. Account Auth Token Page                                                                                                                                                                   
  review the implementation : POST to the /<account>/auth_token endpoint with no content returns an html form with the new token : Displays the token but has no generation/regeneration UI on the page itself (the sidebar reset button works). Could add a "Regenerate" button that calls the token endpoint.                 
                                                                                                                                                                                               
  10. Invitation System                                                                                                                                                                        
  propose how to implement, but low priority : InvitationsNewPage has an email form, InvitationsIndexPage has Send/Delete links that are href="#" with no handlers. Needs POST/DELETE calls to an invitations API endpoint.                 

  11. Email Confirmation Resend                                                                                                                                                                
  ConfirmationsPage form has no handler. Needs a POST to resend the confirmation email.                                                                                                        

  12. Account Unlock                                                                                                                                                                           
  review the implementation : the "forgot your password" link works : UnlocksPage form has no handler. Needs a POST to request an unlock email.                                                                                                                    

  13. Admin Pages                                                                                                                                                                              
  propose how to implement this as a separate single-page-application : AdminMenuPage links to 6 admin routes (/admin/manage/accounts, /admin/manage/repositories, /admin/history/*) that don't exist in the router. Requires new page classes, routes, and API integration for each admin function.                                                                                                                                                         

  14. Queries Index Page                                                                                                                                                                       
  which page is this? QueriesIndexPage returns only an <h1> heading with no list. Needs to call fetchRepositoryViews and render the list, similar to how views are listed in the repository pane.                  

  15. Repository Import Success Flow                                                                                                                                                           
  review the implementation : the page ma be superseded by the current import process : RepositoryImportSuccessPage exists but is never navigated to since imports don't work. Will become relevant once import (#2) is implemented.  


respond to the Actual Gaps by implementing the following :

  Actual Gaps, by Priority

  1. Repository Creation : implement this as a popup dialog similar to new view. persist as a POST to /system/accounts/{account}/repositories with the simple configuration object (just name and type (lmdb or lmdb-revisioned) as fields. on success, navigate to the new repository's pane for editing.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                                                               
  2. Password Changes                                                                                                                                                                          
  Implementation: attach input listeners to the password fields so they register as deltas in the account tracker. The save flow already POSTs changed fields to /system/accounts/{account}/configuration — password fields just need to be included in that delta collection.                 
                                                                                                                                                                                               
  3. Auth Token Persistence                                                                                                                                                                    
  change the reset button to not generate a local SHA-1 token, but rather to POST to /{account}/auth_token with no content. it returns an html response with the new token. Parse the response and update the display.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                                               
  4. Account Creation (Signup)
  the signup page is present and independent of account creation.
  implement the account creation as part of a separate single-page admin application, as a post to /system/accounts with the name as a minimal configuration. create an account pane to permit editing. this differentiates admin-created accounts from self-signup (as your notes indicate).                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                               
  5. Password Reset / Unlock Pages                                                                                                                                                             
  this is implemented as a link from "forgot your password" to an external page. that page links to further external resources.
                                                                                                                                                                                               
  6. Invitation System                                                                                                                                                                         
  Implement this as part of a separate single-page admin application: wire up POST/DELETE to the invitations endpoint. Low priority per your notes.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                               
  7. Admin Pages (separate SPA)                                                                                                                                                                
  Implement this as part of a separate single-page admin application. The current AdminMenuPage links to 6 undefined routes. Implementation: new SPA with its own routes, page classes,  
  and API calls for account/repository management and history views.
