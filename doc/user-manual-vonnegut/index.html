            <h2>Welcome, Earthling</h2>
            <p>Listen: This is a manual about a computer program called Dydra Studio. The program lets you store data and ask it questions. The data is stored as something called RDF, which stands for Resource Description Framework. Don't worry about that. Most people don't.</p>

            <p>Here's the thing about data: we make a lot of it. We make so much data that we need special programs to keep track of it all. This is one of those programs. It's pretty good at what it does.</p>

            <h3>What Can This Thing Do?</h3>
            <p>Dydra Studio is what programmers call a "single-page web application." That means it all happens in one browser window. No refreshing. No waiting. Well, some waiting. There's always some waiting.</p>

            <p>Here's what you can do with it:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Store data in repositories (boxes for your data)</li>
                <li>Ask questions using SPARQL (a language for talking to data)</li>
                <li>Import and export your data (get it in, get it out)</li>
                <li>Create views (saved questions you can ask again)</li>
                <li>Edit information about yourself and your data</li>
                <li>Share with others (if you're feeling generous)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>

            <h3>The Address</h3>
            <p>Type this into your browser:</p>
            <div class="note">
                <strong>URL:</strong> <code>https://dydra.com/ui/user</code>
            </div>
            <p>That's it. That's the door. Walk through it.</p>

            <h3>Your Browser</h3>
            <p>You'll need a modern browser. Here's what that means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>JavaScript needs to work (it probably does)</li>
                <li>Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge will all do the job</li>
                <li>Get the latest version if you can</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If your browser is from the last decade, you should be fine. If it's older than that, well, I admire your commitment to the past.</p>

            <h3>Two Interfaces</h3>
            <p>There are two versions of this thing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User App</strong>: This is what you'll use. It's for regular humans.</li>
                <li><strong>Console</strong>: This is for administrators. It's covered somewhere else.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This manual is about the User App. That's probably what you want.</p>

            <h3>Quick Start</h3>
            <p>Here's what you do:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go to <strong>https://dydra.com/ui/user</strong></li>
                <li>Log in (see the <a href="login.html">Login</a> section)</li>
                <li>Do whatever you came here to do</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Simple enough. Everything is simple when you break it down into steps.</p>

            <h3>This Manual</h3>
            <p>The manual is organized into sections. Each section covers something different:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><a href="login.html">Login</a></strong> - How to get in</li>
                <li><strong><a href="account-operations.html">Account Operations</a></strong> - Who you are</li>
                <li><strong><a href="repository-operations.html">Repository Operations</a></strong> - Your data</li>
                <li><strong><a href="view-operations.html">View Operations</a></strong> - Your questions</li>
                <li><strong><a href="tips-and-best-practices.html">Tips and Best Practices</a></strong> - Helpful advice</li>
                <li><strong><a href="appendices.html">Appendices</a></strong> - Reference material</li>
            </ul>
